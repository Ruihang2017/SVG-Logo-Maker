# SVG-Logo-Maker
Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. I have utilised npm, node.js, jest testing framework and javascript to create this tool. I have used inquirer.js to create command line interface for user input. The logo is generated and written to a file using fs mode.
